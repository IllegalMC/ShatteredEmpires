 - ~~Corpse spawning - The plugin will automatically spawn corpses for you when you die.~~

## Credits
This plugin is made possible by the following people:
 - [G_Rplayer](https://github.com/GersomR-afk) - The devman of this plugin.
 - [NacOJerk (From the Spigot forums)](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-to-make-custom-potions-and-brewing-recipes.211002/) - The original author on how to create custom potions.

## Small note
This plugin is a mess, the codebase is inconsistent, and the code is not clean. It works, and I don't want to get my hand dirty with custom potions, as that is an area I am not familiar with. If anyone wants to help with this plugin, please open an issue on the GitHub page.

## Dependencies
This plugin is dependent on ProtocolLib. Just download the jar file from [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/), and place it in your plugins folder.

## License
This plugin is licensed under the [MIT license](/LICENSE.txt). It is open source, I don't really mind what you use it for. As long as you don't straight up steal anything from ShatterEmpires, feel free to use it for whatever you want.
